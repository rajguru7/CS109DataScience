    "##Overview\n",
    "Online book store in Korea is as prosperous as in any other countries in the world. It has about 36% of entire book market share in Korea, and this number is consitently growing every year. <i>Yes24</i> is the leading online book store in Korea, having 44% of online book market. However, <i>Yes24</i> doesn't have a recommender system not so good that it often recommends totally irrelavant books, or even a goods that is not a book. <i>Yes24</i> recently opened a competition where data scientists suggest a solution for accurate book recommender, releasing the purchase history of 19,000 users within 2014. This motivated us to build a book recommeder algorithm, using the technique we've learned throughout the semester. <br><br>\n",
    "We've tried three different algorithms: one is based on popularities of books and the other on k-nearest neighbor (kNN) with user similarity and book similarity. As a result, we found that kNN with user similarity has the best recommendation accuracy"
